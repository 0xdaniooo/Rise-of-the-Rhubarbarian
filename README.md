# Rise-of-the-Rhubarbarian
Source code for various mechanics I've created as part of my 2nd year of college game jam (excludes other game scripts) (game playable at https://0xdaniooo.itch.io/rise-of-the-rhubarbarian-game-jam)

## Features
- Interactable objects
- Weapon logic
- Checkpoint system
- Ability to respawn at checkpoints rather than restarting scene
- Three different custom made puzzle games

## Things I've learnt
- Taking advantage of for each loops
- Creating complex game mechanics and systems
- Making scripts that can be easily used by others for various purposes
